# maze-solver
Generates a random maze, then solves it. Written in p5. (https://p5js.org/). Based on Daniel Shiffman's (@shiffman) p5 videos with some improvements. Like that it can solve the maze, and the code is generalised enough that the 'maze' can be used to represent most kinds of constraint satisfaction graph problems.

# Technicals
In the initial version it uses a greedy algorithm.
