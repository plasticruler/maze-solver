# maze-solver
Generates a random maze, then solves it. Written in Javascript using the p5.js library. (https://p5js.org/). Based on Daniel Shiffman's (@shiffman) p5 videos with some improvements. I added the ability to solve the maze, and the code is generalised enough that the 'maze' can be used to represent most kinds of constraint satisfaction graph problems.

# Technicals
In the initial version it uses the depth-first greedy algorithm.
